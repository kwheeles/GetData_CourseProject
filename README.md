Summary of transformation:

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Processing reads in all data files, combines in a dataframe adding subject and activity (text derived from activity code).

Select the mean and std columns.

Clean up the labelling to make it human readable.

Summarize into a tidy data set based on group_by for activity and sujbect.
